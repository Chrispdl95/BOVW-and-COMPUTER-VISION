# BOVW-and-COMPUTER-VISION
In this repository i have implemented a BoVW model to classify images into 10
categories. A dogs breeds dataset with 918 images of 10 different classes has been
used as a benchmark to train the SVM model.SIFT and ORB have been used as
feature extraction with SIFT presenting slightly better perfomance metrics.For
vocabulary generation we used K-Mean Mini Batch technique and then try
unsuccessfully to run the experiments with other techniques like DBSCAN and
OPTICS probably due to the large amount of dataset.The different ratio of train
set does not seem to have any significant impact on the perfomance metrics
